<font color=''#ff8ae5''>Light-touched
</font>Use a Lumenstone Shard to increase attack speed and all damage by <font color=''#ff8ae5''>20%</font> for <font color=''#ff8ae5''>10</font> sec. Switches from shadow-touched to light-touched status for <font color=''#ff8ae5''>30</font> min. While light-touched, successful attacks reduce the target''s defense by <font color=''#ff8ae5''>1%</font> for <font color=''#ff8ae5''>1</font> sec.

In battlegrounds and arenas, bonus damage reduced by half, and item abilities are inactive. You must have one in both hands to gain the bonus attack increase and defense reduction effects.'
guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>
Countless lumarigons and humans were sacrificed to forge this. If you listen closely, you can hear whispers promising unlimited power. Other than that, it''s an ordinary orb.</font>
