guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>A weapon created by processing the fragment of Nutaman the Rune Titan.
It is recorded that a spell was placed on Nutaman to detect the challenger''s power and will in order to discern the one worthy to inherit the power of the rune. The power of this spell transferred over to the fragment that became a weapon reacting to its owner''s power. That is why the possessor of this majestic weapon is tested continually, and it is said that it overcomes the owner and runs wild in situations where one''s limits are being challenged.</font>'
