guide_description: '
<font color=''#7A7A7A''>This accessory is granted only to the direct royal line of Tairen. It''s mostly used for ceremonial purposes, but the technology integrated within is cutting edgeâ€”perhaps a direct gift from its designer, the AI Jessica, to the royals. It is as majestic as is fitting for its intended wearer.</font>'
