tooltip_description: 'In another age, Zakum was a meager tree spirit. Even though it had little power of its own, it was beloved by the people who lived in its shade. Over time, they grew to worship it, and it fed upon their adoration.

As his faithful grew in numbers, they built a grand altar to Zakum. In its completion, it was so glorious that Zakum abandoned its tree and inhabited the great stone statue. And where once it fed upon its followers'' adoration, now it fed upon their very souls.'
