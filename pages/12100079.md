tooltip_description: 'A belt awarded to the champion of Duel Square. Despite being an underground fighting ring, the large number of highly skilled fighters who compete make the championship title a great and highly-prized achievement. Championship belts are so highly valued on the black market that the only champion yet to sell theirs is Vasara Chen, the Square''s 53rd champion.'
