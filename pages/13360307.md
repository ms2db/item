tooltip_description: '<font color=''#ff8ae5'' class=''fw-bold''>Bombardment Support</font>
Humanitas forces bombards nearby enemies on hit, dealing <font color=''#ff8ae5''>685%</font> damage every <font color=''#ff8ae5''>5</font> sec. Active while a Tairen Royal Codex is equipped. The effect can''t be triggered in battlegrounds or arenas.'
guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>This accessory is granted only to the direct royal line of Tairen. It''s mostly used for ceremonial purposes, but the technology integrated within is cutting edgeâ€”perhaps a direct gift from its designer, the AI Jessica, to the royals. It is as majestic as is fitting for its intended wearer.</font>'
