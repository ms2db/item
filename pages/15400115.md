tooltip_description: '<font color=''#ff8ae5''>This item''s damage is lowered in battlegrounds and arenas.</font>

Reverse gear is touched by the dark energies which warped reality when the Black Mage''s seal on the Land of Darkness broke. The reversed powers within make it easier to face the twisted creatures lurking in reversed space. As reality warps further, reverse gear will only grow stronger.'
