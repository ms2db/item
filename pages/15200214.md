<font color=''#ff8ae5''>Light-touched
</font>Use a Lumenstone Shard to increase attack speed and all damage by <font color=''#ff8ae5''>20%</font> for <font color=''#ff8ae5''>10</font> sec. Switches from shadow-touched to light-touched status for <font color=''#ff8ae5''>30</font> min.

guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>
"A true mage matches strength of mind with strength of body." The unconventional archmage, Hines Gertolf Dajerius, demonstrated this philosophy during the war on darkness. Impressed, the lumarigons gifted him this combination staff/halberd. Unfortunately, he had to turn it down, as it "looked too scary" for the great mage.</font>'
