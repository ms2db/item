tooltip_description: 'Places a heavenly crepe cake down for <font color=''#00aaef''>15</font> sec. If a party member moves within <font color=''#00aaef''>3</font>Â m of the cake, they will eat it to increase health by <font color=''#00aaef''>300</font> and defense by <font color=''#00aaef''>6%</font> for <font color=''#00aaef''>15</font> min. Does not stack with defensive elixirs. The effect will continue even after death.'
