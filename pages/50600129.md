tooltip_description: 'Guardsman Marmut has made it his mission to provide a mount for all of Maple World''s heroes. Since he can''t afford that many horses, he''s personally giving them all piggyback rides, instead. Is this how Empress Ereve gets around?'
guide_description: 'Double-click in your inventory or use in a quickslot to get on and off the mount. While mounted, hold the basic attack key and a direction key to perform a special action.'
