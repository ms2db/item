tooltip_description: 'It''s said that these were made from Infernog''s actual horns. The great demon has tormented humanity over the generations, also returning whenever a new hero would rise up to seal him away.

Thanks to the new power obtained in Kritias, his rein of terror has ended once and for all.'
