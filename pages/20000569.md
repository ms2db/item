tooltip_description: 'Places fresh fruit for <font color=''#00aaef''>15</font> sec. If a party member moves within <font color=''#00aaef''>3</font>Â m of the fruit, they will eat it to increase max health by <font color=''#00aaef''>6%</font> for <font color=''#00aaef''>15</font> min. Does not stack with defensive elixirs. The effect will continue even after death.'
guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>
Many farmers lose their lives every year in the ongoing war against fruit-thieving monkeys. Honor their sacrifice by sharing a sweet snack with the ones you hold dear.</font>'
