guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>
The core of this bow is made from the wing of Godmother Lucaracia, reinforced with ravensteel. It is said that the forces of darkness captured Lucaracia and made this weapon while she still drew breath. The mere sight of it threw the lumarigons into a rage.</font>'
