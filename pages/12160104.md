<font color=''#7A7A7A''>This gear was created using shards of armor worn by the Terrun Callibre commanders when they were under the influence of dark lapenta. Though it''s been purified, it still pulses with great power. If its wearer acts with discretion and skill, then that power can be theirs.</font>
