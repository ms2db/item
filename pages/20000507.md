tooltip_description: 'A single drop from these eye drops will allow your eyes to detect mesos with greater ease than ever before. After using, monsters drop <font color=''#ff5400''>50%</font> more mesos for <font color=''#00aaef''>15</font> min. Applying too many of the eye drops in such a short period of time may have an adverse effect on your vision, so there is a <font color=''#ff5400''>15</font> minute cooldown before it can be used again.'
