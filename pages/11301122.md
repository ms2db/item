guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>
Exclusive combat gear of the Crimson Balrogs, the most elite band of balrog soldiers. Their gear is different from that of regular soldiers, having been polished by Ancient Balrog hellfire and crafted in ancient techniques. Many years have passed, but it''s still sturdy and powerful. Although it was created using forgotten techniques and thus can''t be repaired with modern techniques, this gear will never break until all wars end in this world.</font>'
