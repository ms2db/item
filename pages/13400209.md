<font color=''#ff8ae5''>Light-touched</font>
Use a Lumenstone Shard to increase attack speed and all damage by <font color=''#ff8ae5''>20%</font> for <font color=''#ff8ae5''>10</font> sec. Switches from shadow-touched to light-touched status for <font color=''#ff8ae5''>30</font> min.

guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>
This weapon is also known as the Reaper''s Blade. Most assassins covet daggers like this as a rare treasure, but it was in fact standard issue for the lumarigon army. The technology that allowed such a powerful item to be mass produced is now long lost.</font>'
