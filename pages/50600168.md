icon_url: 'item/icon/50600168.png'
tooltip_description: 'When Zakum fell, a portion of his evil power remained in this hand. It now serves as a terribly uncomfortable mount. Some people think the hand walks like a spider because it''s possessed by the ghost of a spider that Zakum crushed, but these people are idiots.'
guide_description: 'Double-click in your inventory or use in a quickslot to get on and off the mount. While mounted, hold the basic attack key and a direction key to perform a special action.'
