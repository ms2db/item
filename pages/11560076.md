guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>An expertly crafted piece of armor that once belonged to Athanasia, the legendary Dragon Hunter. Athanasia is said to have specially crafted a suit of armor for each dragon she would face, and their craftsmanship was without peer. The armors remained unscratched, despite having taken blows from some of the fiercest dragons to ever roam the land. Athanasia guaranteed her armor for the lifespan of its wearer, though this claim was never put to the test, as the whole lot of them vanished mysteriously long ago.</font>'
