<font color=''#7A7A7A''>The legendary Dragon Hunter. A first class weapon of Athanasia''s anti-dragon equipment. Athanasia, who mastered over 13 kinds of equipment to go against various dragon races, was famous for directly creating weapons for personal use. Among those many types, the ones called the ''Undying'' were the best among the 20 tiers and were created with the best material and technique, making them masterpieces worthy of being called Dragon Hunters. Although Athanasia and their weapons disappeared without a trace one day, based on the legends, the ''Undying'' weapons lay dormant as eternal mementos in the hands of a great evil.</font>'
