tooltip_description: 'Gear used by the first expedition of Knights to venture into the Land of Darkness in the War of Light and Darkness. Born from a partnership between expert blacksmiths and great mages, these powerful items were lost and forgotten when the Shadow Gate was sealed following the demise of the expedition team. Not only is this gear incredibly rare, it is also dangerous, as it may have been touched by either the light, or darkness.'
