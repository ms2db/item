guide_description: '<font color=''#7A7A7A''>
Kandura was an apostate member of the Guidance and the leader of BeyondLink. Also known as the Shadow Hunter, he possessed the ability to command living shadows. The BeyondLink research staff sought to extract this power and turn it into a powerful magical artifact. Known as the Tris Project A series, they tested their creation in the form of a belt which inadvertently transformed the test subject into a mass of shadows. The researchers have attempted to cover up the results of their experiment, but the A series remains hidden somewhere, creating ever more ravenous shadows.</font>'
