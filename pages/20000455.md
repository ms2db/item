tooltip_description: 'A fragment of a magical stone once used by the lumarigons, the dragons of light. Even though it''s just a shard, it still contains the power to awaken lumarium weapons. It''s a good thing that only these fragments remainâ€”if the wrong people got hold of a complete lumenstone, they could unlesh untold destruction.'
