tooltip_description: '$npcName:21000053$ droppings. The creature''s fiery stomach burns away the toxins in the moss it eats and leaves only a nutritionally dense, if smelly, snack. It''s become a rarity ever since $npcName:11000273$ of $map:02000076$ started praising it as a health food. If you''re feeling adventurous, consume it to increase physical attack by <font color=''#00aaef''>1</font> for <font color=''#00aaef''>1</font> minute.'
